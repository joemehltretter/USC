The Pixel&hairsp;/&hairsp;Nexus Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
and functional improvements affecting supported
Google Pixel and Nexus devices (Google devices).
For Google devices, security patch levels of 2017-11-05 or later also address all
issues in this bulletin. To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see Check and update your
Android version.

All supported Google devices will receive an update to the 2017-11-05 patch
level. We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

Note: The Google device firmware images are available on the Google Developer site.

In addition to the security vulnerabilities described in the November 2017 Android
Security Bulletin, Pixel and Nexus devices also contain patches for the
security vulnerabilities described below. Partners were notified of these issues
at least a month ago and may choose to incorporate them as part of their device
updates.

Vulnerabilities are grouped under the component that they affect. There is a
description of the issue and a table with the CVE, associated references, type of vulnerability, severity,
and updated Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions (where applicable). When
available, we link the public change that addressed the issue to the bug ID,
like the AOSP change list. When multiple changes relate to a single bug,
additional references are linked to numbers following the bug ID.

These updates are included for affected Pixel devices to address functionality
issues not related to the security of Pixel devices. The table includes
associated references; the affected category, such as Bluetooth or mobile data;
and a summary of the issue.

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?


Security patch levels of 2017-11-05 or later address all issues associated with
the 2017-11-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels. To learn how
to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on the Pixel
and Nexus update schedule.

2. What do the entries in the Type column mean?

Entries in the Type column of the vulnerability details table reference
the classification of the security vulnerability.

3. What do the entries in the References column mean?

Entries under the References column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

4. What does a * next to the Android bug ID in the References
column mean?

Issues that are not publicly available have a * next to the Android bug ID in
the References column. The update for that issue is generally contained
in the latest binary drivers for Nexus devices available from the Google Developer
site.

5. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and the
Android Security Bulletins?

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in the Android Security Bulletins
are required in order to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities, such as those documented in this
bulletin, are not required for declaring a security patch level.
