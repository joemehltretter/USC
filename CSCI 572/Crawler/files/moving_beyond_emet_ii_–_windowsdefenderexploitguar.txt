Information from Microsoft about vulnerabilities, mitigations and workarounds, active attacks, security research, tools and guidanceSince we last wrote about the future of EMET and how it relates to Windows 10 back in November 2016 (see Moving Beyond EMET), we have received lots of invaluable feedback from EMET customers and enthusiasts regarding the upcoming EMET end of life. Based on that feedback, we are excited to share significant new exploit protection and threat mitigation improvements coming with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update!We recently introduced Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) which will complete our journey to incorporate all of the security benefits of EMET directly into Windows. This effort was significantly influenced by two insights that came up most frequently in our survey data, customer support calls, and conversations with EMET stakeholders and security enthusiasts. More than anything else, our customers have expressed that they want (1) a user-friendly UI for configuring mitigation settings and (2) a way to protect their legacy apps on Windows 10.As such, with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, you can now audit, configure, and manage Windows system and application exploit mitigations right from the Windows Defender Security Center (WDSC). You do not need to deploy or install Windows Defender Antivirus or any other additional software to take advantage of these settings, and WDEG will be available on every Windows 10 PC running the Fall Creators Update. Windows Insiders can start trying out WDEG today following these simple steps:In addition to the new user-friendly interface in WDSC, we have added the same legacy app protections that our EMET customers have come to expect, thus achieving parity between Windows 10 mitigation support and all of the mitigation features provided by EMET. While we strongly recommend the use of Control Flow Guard (CFG) to provide the strongest protections available, we understand that many enterprises depend on legacy apps to run their business operations, many of which may never get recompiled with CFG. These users can now use Exploit Guard to help secure such apps on modern systems by configuring control flow protections for legacy apps, similar to those offered by EMET but built-in directly to Windows 10 as part of WDEG. These legacy app control flow protections include:Another common ask from our customers was for auditing support. To facilitate easy deployment and usage of mitigations without the burden of application compatibility side effects, we have introduced audit mode support for both EMET legacy app mitigations as well as existing native mitigations provided by Windows.Although EMET shipped with a set of recommended configuration settings, we know that many EMET customers customized the policy to suit the specific needs of their business. To help facilitate the migration to Windows Defender Exploit Guard, we have added a new PowerShell module that converts EMET XML settings files into Windows 10 mitigation policies for WDEG. More information about this PowerShell module, and about how EMET features relate to security features in Windows 10, can be found in the topic Understanding Windows 10 in relation to the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit.Lastly, Windows Defender Exploit Guard includes much more than the features integrated from EMET, and we look forward to discussing host intrusion prevention capabilities and other WDEG components in a future blog post. In terms of upcoming features, WDEG will soon be fully integrated with Windows Defender ATP (WDATP) to provide a single-pane-of-glass view across the Windows security stack. Violations of configured WDEG mitigations will be logged by WDATP and used as additional signals for more advanced exploit detection.For more details on Windows 10’s threat mitigations, please refer to our Windows 10 Threat Mitigations documentation on Microsoft Docs.- Nate Nunez, OS SecurityName * Email * Website  

Thanks for those great and confirmed news about CFG and WDEG. Can you please tell me if EAF+ is also includet within those Fall Creators Update modules? As long as I understand, EAF is includet and IAF is new to FCU? What about EAF+?Hi, this is really awesome, and I’m grateful that you’re pushing ahead with this project.
Having tried the converter, and the current GUI in the Windows Insider build 16251, I do have some questions.
When I use the converter on my current EMET configs, the system-level mitigations don’t appear to be in the converted config (there’s no system tag).
I’m not sure if this is the intended behavior or not- in the 16251 build, it looks like the system-level mitigations are all on, and cranked up to the highest levels, and then the application list is mainly to specify any exceptions one way or the other.  So if the system-level protections will always be on and set to a high (or the highest) level, there’s no need to carry over the system-level settings in the converted config.
If we want to test out our current EMET configs on one of the preview builds with Windows Defender Exploit Guard, is this the recommended way to do so?
Convert current config with tool
Install process-mitigation on machine with appropriate preview build
Use Powershell to import config
Verify settings have been imported through the Windows Defender Exploit Guard UIAlso, how can we provide feedback to you and the team on this product? Twitter, email, some forum, something else?Thank you!
