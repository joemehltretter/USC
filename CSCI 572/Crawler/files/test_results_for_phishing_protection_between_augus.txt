A web browser requests reputation information about a specific URL, and if results indicate that the website is “bad,” the browser redirects the user to a warning message explaining that the URL is malicious. If a website is determined to be “good,” the browser takes no action and the user remains unaware that a security check was just performed.To evaluate a browser’s effectiveness in protecting against phishing attacks, NSS’ testing focused on block rates, consistency of protection, and early protection against new threats. PRODUCTS EVALUATED:The following products were evaluated: NSS clients can also download the Web Browser Security Comparative Report on Protection Against Socially Engineered Malware (SEM).As with all NSS Labs group tests, there was no fee for participation.
