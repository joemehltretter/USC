The four vulnerabilities found by Rad include:“While some devices were impacted, the issues have been patched and updates are available both automatically and manually as indicated in the Security Advisory,” Lenovo told Threatpost.When asked, Lenovo wouldn’t say what percentage of its more than 20 million Android tablets sold since 2015, according to IDC, have been patched. All its phones have received patches it said. “We take all vulnerabilities seriously. Patches for this are complete and readily available,” a spokesperson said.Lenovo said it was not aware of any of the vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.“Available actions to attackers include changing system settings, executing shell commands or installing additional packages. Malicious actors could abuse the LSF to deploy code components persistently in parts of the flash memory so that the only removal method would be the factory reset,” Rad said.In the case of CVE-2017-3760, the researcher found the LSF application pulled from remote web services for new system messages. Though the communication was carried out over a cleartext HTTP channel, the server responses were protected by an RSA private key.“The problem is, the RSA private key that belongs to the public pair that was used for the signature checking, could be found on the internet as part of an example application of a software library,” according to his research. That could allow an adversary on an untrusted network (a rogue Wi-Fi AP or GSM network) to leverage a man-in-the-middle attack where an adversary could intercepted the network connection with a malicious polling message. “They could effectively take over the phone (or Lenovo Android device) remotely,” he said.Rad said the vulnerabilities were discovered on May 10 and initial disclosure of the bugs to Lenovo was May 14. Ten days later Lenovo confirmed the vulnerabilities with coordinated public disclosure occurring on Oct. 5.Quando vai sair atualização pra moto zAnd the G5 plus pleaseYour email address will not be published.
