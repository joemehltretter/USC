When we introduced Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP), our initial focus was to reduce the time it takes companies to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks. The Windows Fall Creators Update represents a new chapter in our product evolution as we offer a set of new prevention capabilities designed to stop attacks as they happen and before they have impact. This means that our service will expand beyond detection, investigation, and response, and will now allow companies to use the full power of the Windows security stack for preventative protection. The stack will be powered by our cloud-based security intelligence, which moves us from a world of isolated defenses to a smart, interconnected, and coordinated defense grid that is more intelligent, simple to manage, and ever-evolving.We will also provide a single pane of glass experience for security professionals. This means that security management (SecMgmt) teams can easily configure a broad set of Windows security stack technologies through an integrated configuration management experience. Security operations (SecOps) teams get full visibility into their Windows endpoint security and a rich toolset to take action using the Windows Defender ATP console. This will not only give companies a full picture of what’s happening on their endpoints, but will also put them in the driver seat to quickly react to threats as they happen. Leveraging our cloud-based security intelligence gives the optics, context, and tools that companies need to quickly investigate and remediate incidents.Here are some highlights of the Windows Fall Creators Update:Figure 1: Windows Defender ATP machine timeline view with Windows Defender Exploit Guard eventFigure 2: Windows Defender ATP new dashboard viewFigure 3: Windows Defender ATP machine timeline view with Windows Defender Application Guard eventFigure 4: Security AnalyticsFinally, we plan to extend Windows Defender ATP to also cover the Windows Server platform, starting with Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016 releases.
