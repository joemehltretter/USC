# Threat Intel Crawler

This program crawls threatpost, securitynewsportal, and hackread,
to locate cyber news articles. It will download relevant articles
and store in a directory. The articles downloaded will be sent to
an HDFS repository.

## Purpose

I created this program using knowledge gained from my Information Retrieval
and Web Search Engine course at USC.
